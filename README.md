# Image-Classification-Model

** I have build a model that can classify a given set of images according to the apparel (shirt, trousers, shoes, socks, etc.). It’s actually a problem faced by many e-commerce retailers which makes it an even more interesting computer vision problem.

** We have a total of 70,000 images (28 x 28 dimension), out of which 60,000 are from the training set and 10,000 from the test one. The training images are pre-labelled according to the apparel type with 10 total classes. The test images are, of course, not labelled. The challenge is to identify the type of apparel present in all the test images.

** I have build our model on Google Colab since it provides a free GPU to train our models.
